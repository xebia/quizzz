Quizzz
=====
Quizzz is intended to explore and learn Android. Any useful functionality is considered a nice to have by product. Still, we think this is a rather nice app. The original idea was to use foto's of collegues to help us memorize each others names. However, we felt we couldn't publish their foto's for all the world to see, so we're using a set of pictures of birds native to India in stead. 

It is currently a working prototype.

We plan to add the following functions (list is in no particular order):
- add an options button to load a set of pictures (so we can have the collegue quiz after all).
- build the app with Maven.
- find out how to unit/integration test Android
