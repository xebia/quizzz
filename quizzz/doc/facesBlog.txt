My first Android app
====================

Introduction
------------
With everybody going mobile, we could not stay behind. This meant we had
to create an Android application, because we do not own one of them fancy iPhones.
Also, Android is way cooler.

To begin our journey to become an Android developer, we decided to
create Quizzz: a quizz to help you learn the names of your collegues (or TODO>>>>). This
would give us a simple application that would require only a small subset of the Android API. We also wanted to fammiliarize ourselves with the Android development cycle
from interaction design to development, testing, and deployment.

After installing the [Android development
environment](http://developer.android.com/index.html) we where faced
with the problem of designing our application.

Design
------
The idea of Quizzz is to show a screen with a picture, from our Xebia facebook originally, and then provide the user with three names to choose from. On a whiteboard it looks like this:

<IMAGE HERE>

The top left part shows the starting screen: three buttons with random names of
collegues, one of which is the name of the person shown in the picture
above. If you choose the correct name, you end up in the top right
screen. If you press the wrong button, you end up in the lower right
screen which shows you the correct answer and a button that takes you to
the top right screen where you can see the picture of the collegue you
have choosen.

We decided to implement the application as a single Activity. Activities
are subsets of your application which can combine into a one workflow by
going from one activity to another. The back button on the phone takes you to the previous activity (not necessarily the previous content of the screen) so Activities limit the way the user can navigate through the app. Because there is no back
functionality in our application, we decided to create the whole
thing in one Activity. We use layout switching to present the user
with different screens.

Code
----
To download the code, visit http://github.com/xebia/quizzz and clone the
repository.

We defined two layouts, main.xml and result.xml. The first shows the
left side of the design and the second the right part of the design (see picture below).

If you start the app QuizActivity is started. The Android framework calls the onCreate() method to do the required initialization. In our case this includes loading a set of images from a directory. We choose a list of birds common to India as a sample set, but any set of pictures will do. The last act of onCreate() is to call layoutQuestion(). This method randomly selects three images from the set loaded before, assigns them to buttons and then hooks up itself in the setOnClickListener() method of each button.  
The buttons are stored in a HashMap<Button, AssetQuizItem> so they can be retrieved later in the onClick() method

onClick() uses the clicked button as an index in the HashMap mentioned above to find the answer that was choosen by the users and delegates to either layoutIfAnswerIsCorrect() or layoutIfAnswerIsWrong(). Both methods fill in data on a new view based on the answer supplied by the user. The methods end with a block of code that sets up a new Button and a listener to allow the user to take the next step. 

TODO: menu button…
